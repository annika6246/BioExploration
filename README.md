# BioExploration
This repository contains code for analyzing biological data using C++ libraries. It includes functionality for building a classification model for antibiotic-resistant bacterial sequences, a KMeans Clustering model for SSTA records, and an alignment score calculator for protein sequences of different species.

This program takes no command line arguments and requires the libraries [MLPack](github.com/mlpack) and version 2.4 of [SeqAn](github.com/seqan).
